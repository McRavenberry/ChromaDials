# ChromaDial
## Description
This clicker game challenges you to correctly capture the amount of red, green, and blue required to match the color in the background. The three dials control the amount of each color shown on the screen. Match the RGB color values for all three to advance to the next color. Complete five color combos as quickly as possible. Can you earn a new high score?


## How to Play
Press ***PLAY*** to load the game. Once you have entered the game, you can ***START*** or ***PAUSE*** the game by clicking the button in the bottom left corner. 

When you start the game, the dials will automatically start turning clockwise. Click on a ***DIAL*** to stop it from turning. Click it again to make it spin in the opposite direction. Stop the ***DIALS*** when they match the corresponding light bulbs over the television. Match the three dials to advance to the next color. The ***DIALS*** automatically start turning again when you enter the next stage.

Correctly match the red, green, and blue amounts for five colors as quickly as possible. If you complete the game faster than a previous run, it will update the best time in the game.

## Additional Comments
This game was made for during a game jam I hosted for my year 2 and 3 programming class.

The theme of the game jam was ***Chromatic Harmony***. I used three of the twelve possible diversifiers: ***dials***, ***puzzle***, and ***time***. The table below shows the available diversifiers for the game jam. The rules stated the game must include at least two diversifiers in the final game.
|  Possible Diversifiers  |   |   |
| --| -- | -- |
| Monocromatic | Color-driven gravity | Music as a weapon |
| Single button | Local co-op | **Puzzle** |
| Chroma-charged abilities | Make music | **Time** |
| Paintbrush | **Dials** | Color-blind mode |



I told my students I would make a game for the game jam as well, and this is the final result. It was made using **Godot 4.1**. All graphics were made by me. Audio files were taken from various CC0 sources.
